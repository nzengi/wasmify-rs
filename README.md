# Wasmify-RS

Wasmify-RS is a modular Rust-based framework designed for developing and optimizing WebAssembly (Wasm) applications. It provides essential tools such as smart contract deployment, interaction, gas estimation, monitoring, and parallelized optimization. This framework is suitable for developers looking to streamline and improve the performance of WebAssembly-based projects in the blockchain space.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Deployment & Interaction**: Deploy contracts and interact with them using simple Rust functions.
- **Gas Management**: Estimate gas usage and dynamically optimize gas allocation for smart contract executions.
- **Contract Monitoring**: Monitor contract activity, track events, and poll contract status at defined intervals.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Perform optimized gas operations asynchronously using the `tokio` runtime.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging system with customizable log levels and output formatting.

## Installation

To use `Wasmify-RS` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasmify-rs = "0.1.0"
log = "0.4"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

Basic Contract Deployment
Here's a simple example of deploying a contract using Wasmify-RS:
```rust
use wasmify_rs::deploy_contract;

fn main() {
    let contract_code = vec![/* contract bytecode */];
    let gas_limit = 100_000;
    let sender_address = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678";

    deploy_contract(&contract_code, gas_limit, sender_address)
        .expect("Contract deployment failed.");
}
```

## Modules Overview

**Contracts Module**

The contracts module handles various operations related to smart contracts, such as deploying contracts, interacting with them, and managing gas optimization.

Deploy Contract: Deploys a contract with a specified gas limit.
Call Contract Function: Interacts with a deployed contract by calling specific functions.
Fetch Contract Data: Retrieves specific data from the contract's storage.
Gas Estimation and Optimization: Estimates gas usage and dynamically adjusts for optimal performance.
Framework Module
The framework module provides utilities for running and optimizing WebAssembly applications, as well as performing asynchronous operations and logging.

Optimized Operations: Asynchronously optimizes gas usage for smart contract execution.
Logging: Customizable logging for tracking operations and debugging.

## Example

Here is an example of monitoring a contract's activity and performing gas optimizations asynchronously:

```rust
use wasmify_rs::{monitor_contract_activity, perform_optimized_operations};
use std::time::Duration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Monitor the contract for events
    if let Err(e) = monitor_contract_activity(
        "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678", 
        "EventName", 
        Duration::from_secs(5)
    ) {
        log::error!("Monitoring failed: {:?}", e);
    }

    // Perform parallel gas optimizations
    perform_optimized_operations().await;
}
```

> ⚠️ **Processing**: Be careful before running on the mainnet. Always test thoroughly on a testnet first to avoid unexpected issues or loss of funds.

### Important Notice

This project interacts with blockchain networks. Please **DO NOT** deploy or interact with contracts on the mainnet until you have tested your implementation extensively on a testnet environment like Ropsten or Görli.

Using untested code on the mainnet could lead to irreversible losses. Make sure you have fully validated the smart contracts, gas estimates, and other interactions.
